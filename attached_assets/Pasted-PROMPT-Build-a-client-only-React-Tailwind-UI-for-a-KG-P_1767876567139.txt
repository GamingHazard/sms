PROMPT — Build a client-only React + Tailwind UI for a KG + Primary School Management System

Overview / Goal
- Build a client-only UI (no backend/server logic or real network connections). Use mock data (local JSON or mocked API using MSW) for all pages and interactions.
- Tech stack: React (v18+), TailwindCSS, React Router, Headless UI / shadcn (optional), lucide-react for icons. Optional: zustand or React Context for lightweight state.
- Fully responsive (mobile → tablet → desktop) and accessible (keyboard, ARIA). Desktop-first admin UX but mobile-friendly for parents/teachers.
- Provide a clean component library, pages for each grouped feature (see list below), and well-documented mock data & README.
- Use modern UI/UX: cards, tables, modals, tooltips, toasts, skeleton loaders, empty states, inline edits, and subtle animations (Framer Motion optional).

Project deliverables
1. A runnable React project (create-react-app, Vite, or Next.js is fine) with Tailwind configured.
2. A README.md explaining how to run, switch roles (Admin/Teacher/Bursar/Parent), and replace mock data with real APIs.
3. Reusable component library (/src/components) — Button, Input, Modal, Table, Tooltip, Avatar, Card, FormField, Badge, Breadcrumb, Pagination, CSV export button, PDF export stub.
4. Pages for each feature (see Page List). Each page uses mock data and demonstrates full UI flows.
5. Mock data in /src/mock/*.json and a simple mock service worker (MSW) or useMockData() hook to simulate network latency and CRUD actions.
6. Tailwind design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) in tailwind.config.js.
7. Accessibility checks: keyboard focus, aria labels, color contrast.
8. A short design spec file (/docs/ui-spec.md) explaining key components, spacing, breakpoints, and interactions.
9. Optional: Storybook or Component Playground (nice to have).

Role simulation
- Include a role switcher in the header for previewing Admin, Head Teacher, Teacher, Bursar, Parent views. This is UI-only and driven by local app state.

Pages (one page per grouped feature + details & behaviors)
Build the following pages. Each page should include mock data and demonstrate actions (create/edit/delete/filters) performed locally.

1. Dashboard (Admin)
- Summary cards: total students, active KG pupils, primary pupils, fees collected (term), attendance today %, overdue fees.
- Charts: small bar for fee collection per term; line chart for attendance trend (use Chart.js or simple SVG).
- Recent activity feed (user actions from mock data).
- Quick actions: Add Student, Create Fee, Create Notice.

2. Students (List page)
- Table with columns: Photo, Admission No., Full name, Level (KG/Primary), Grade, Stream, DOB (age), Parent contact, Status, Actions.
- Features: search, filter by level/grade/stream/status, sort, bulk actions (promote, export CSV), pagination.
- Row actions: View Profile, Edit, Promote, Deactivate.
- Empty state design (invite to add first student).

3. Student Profile (Tabbed)
- Tabs: Overview (biodata), Parents/Guardians, Attendance, Assessments (KG remarks + Primary marks), Fees.
- Overview: show photo, admission no., basic info, emergency contacts, medical notes (optional).
- Parents: list linked parents with contact buttons (phone/email placeholders).
- Attendance tab: calendar-style summary and monthly breakdown; ability to view and export attendance.
- Assessments tab:
  - KG: term-based descriptive remarks (behavior, motor, language). A UI for teachers to add/edit remarks with templates and tooltips.
  - Primary: list exams and subjects; show marks table, auto-computed grade & comment based on grading rules from settings. Allow inline edit.
- Fees tab: show fee structure assigned, payments history, outstanding balance, printable receipt button (client-only).

4. Parents Page
- List of parents, search/filter, view linked students.
- Parent profile page: contact details and linked children. Action: simulate sending notice (UI only).

5. My Classes (Teacher view)
- Shows teacher’s assigned classes/grades and students per class.
- Attendance quick mark UI (presence toggle, bulk present/absent).
- Marks entry UI with validation. For Primary show subject columns; for KG show a textarea for remarks per pupil.
- UX: keyboard shortcuts for moving between students, autosave indicator, validation errors in tooltips.

6. Academics Setup
- Manage Levels (KG/Primary), Grades, Streams (only for Primary), Subjects.
- Drag & drop or reorder grades (order_no).
- Assign subjects to grades and assign teachers to subjects (UI-only dropdown of mock teachers).
- Validation: disallow creating a stream for KG (show contextual tooltip).

7. Assessments (Exams & Marks)
- Create exam (term, name, year), select grade & subjects.
- Marks entry grid, save & preview report card.
- Grading rules table (editable, see Settings).
- Bulk import via CSV (client-only parse & seed).

8. Attendance
- Daily attendance UI by grade/stream.
- Attendance reports: filters date range, export CSV.
- Heatmap view for class attendance over term.

9. Fees Module
- Fee Structures: create/edit structures per level/grade & term.
- Student Payments: record a mock payment (cash, bank, mobile money).
- Student balances and payment history view.
- Bursar dashboard: overdue list, receipts (client-only printable), filters.
- Client-side invoice/receipt generator (HTML → print).

10. Reports
- Generate and preview PDF-style report cards, attendance summaries, fees collection. Use client-side libs (html2pdf/jsPDF stubs, show how to export).
- Filtering and export buttons (CSV / PDF).

11. Notices / Communication
- Create announcement UI, target audiences (All, Grade, Parents only).
- Notification preview modal; show how SMS/email placeholders appear.
- Announcements feed on Dashboard and Parent portal.

12. Users (User & Staff Management)
- CRUD for users (Admin): create teacher, bursar, head teacher, parent accounts.
- Role & permission UI: checkboxes for module access (visual only).
- Bulk invite (mock email send).

13. Settings (Comprehensive)
- General settings
  - School name, address, logo upload (client-only), contact email/phone, term dates (start/end), academic year dropdown.
- Appearance
  - Theme: light/dark toggle, primary color (school brand), font size adjustment.
- Academic settings
  - Levels configuration (add custom levels), grade ordering, default subjects for levels.
- Grading rules
  - Editable table mapping score ranges → grade → comment (applies to Primary). Include "KG behavior templates" for remarks.
- Fees & Payment settings
  - Default payment methods (Cash, Bank, MTN MoMo, Airtel Money), currency symbol, tax/discount rules.
- Notifications
  - Toggle SMS/email, mock provider config (text input fields), default notification templates.
- Security
  - Password policy (min length, complexity), session timeout (UI), 2FA toggle (UI placeholder).
- Data
  - Export data (CSV): students, parents, payments, attendance. Backup / restore mock toggle (client-only).
- Integrations (Placeholder)
  - Toggles for external services (SMS provider, payment gateway) with sample integration info fields.
- Permissions
  - Visual role permissions editor: matrix mapping roles → modules (checkboxes). Changing these should change the role switching behavior client-side.

UI / UX Design details & patterns
- Layout
  - Sidebar navigation with icons and labels on desktop; collapsible; on mobile show bottom nav or slide-out drawer.
  - Page header with breadcrumbs, role switcher, global search, and quick-add dropdown.
  - Use a grid system: 12-column for desktop, stacked for mobile. Breakpoints: sm(640px), md(768px), lg(1024px), xl(1280px).
- Components
  - Tables: sortable columns, column resize optional, inline actions, highlight row on hover, keyboard navigation, accessible table semantics.
  - Forms: grouped fields, clear validation messages, client-side validation rules (required, formats), smart defaults.
  - Tooltips: accessible (aria-describedby), show on hover and focus, with short explanations (e.g., "KG remarks are descriptive only").
  - Modals: use focus trap, escape to close, role-trap for keyboard.
  - Toasts: success/error/confirmations using an accessible live region.
  - Empty & loading states: skeletons for lists, illustrated empty states for no data.
  - Inline edit: small pencil icon to toggle editable state.
- Microinteractions
  - Subtle hover transitions, loading spinners, autosave indicator (dot/pulse), confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
- Accessibility
  - All interactive elements keyboard accessible, visible focus states, ARIA labels on forms, color contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 for text.
- Design system
  - Typography scale, spacing scale (4/8/16 baseline), color tokens (primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, bg, muted).
  - Provide CSS variables or Tailwind theme config for tokens.

Behavior / Acceptance criteria
- All pages present realistic mock data and demonstrate full UI behaviors locally (create/edit/delete simulated).
- Role switcher changes visible menu & permitted actions in the UI (no security enforcement needed beyond UI).
- KG-specific UIs: KG assessments use remarks textareas; Primary uses numeric marks + auto-grade based on settings.
- Forms validate inputs and show accessible error messages.
- Tables support search, filter, and pagination UI.
- Export (CSV/PDF) features work client-side and download a file.
- Visual polish: spacing, consistent color tokens, icons, and tooltips for complex UI elements.
- README explains how to replace mock data with real API endpoints (e.g., how to swap useMockApi with fetch and example endpoint mappings).

Optional nice-to-haves (call out to the agent)
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to simulate realistic API calls and latency.
- Include Storybook or a component playground for components.
- Include light/dark theme persistent in localStorage.
- Add example unit tests for a couple of core components (Jest + React Testing Library).

Final instructions for the AI agent
- Do not create or call any real backend. Everything must be client only.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling and keep components modular and reusable.
- Provide clear comments in code for places where real API integration would happen.
- Write a concise README.md with run instructions, how to switch roles, and how to seed or edit mock data.
- Deliver high-fidelity, production-lean UI code that can be handed to frontend engineers or used directly for demos.
